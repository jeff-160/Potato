# Potato Visual Novel Framework  
  
Potato is a simple visual novel framework written in C++ using the SDL framework. It is designed such that only a basic and fundamental grasp of C++ is required to produce a complete visual novel game from start to finish. No additional module/library installation is required, as all the essential files are already included.  
  
Big thanks to [chen e](https://github.com/56cy) for helping with the SDL setup.  
Extra thanks to [zhogrog](https://github.com/GaoZR2008) for christening this.

## Requirements
1. GNU g++ (update to the latest version)
---

## Project setup
To create a new Potato project:
1. Clone and rename the folder if needed
2. Run the `build.bat` file located in the root directory
3. Enter a project name when prompted, and a `compile.ps1` and `.cpp` file will be generated  
  
A complete Potato project folder will be structured as such (excluding all non-essential files).
```
